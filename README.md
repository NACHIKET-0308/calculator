# calculator
This is just a basic calculator app i made using html , css and jAVA Script 
i learned a lot from this course such as button click , functions and variious other tricks in js 
using various tips to make things work fast,clean and efficiently 
In this application i have put most of thing as taught in class but also included something extra such as history screen and deletion even efter calculation.
